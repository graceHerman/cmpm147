				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					</p>The overworld takes inspiration from The "Legend of Zelda: Link Between Worlds", of Lorule's overworld.
					It gave me ispiration to do a dark themed overworld:</p>

					<p>The dungeon takes inspiration from The "Legend of Zelda: Link Between Worlds", of the dark temple in Lorule. 
					This image is one of the rooms in the temple and gave me iniratin to do a dark themed dungeon:</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> 
					<p>The drawGrid function visualizes the grid using the placeTile function, and applies autotiling to create smoother transitions.
					This function also applies visual effects, such as animated water bubbles.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> I worked n this by myself, and I think I did a good job. 
					This experiment was fun, it was fun to mess around with the tiles, and to be creative with the design.
					I did have a hard time understanding austotiling as it's not something I'm too familiar with. 
					I do think that I could have made it look better, but I think this looks really good either way.
