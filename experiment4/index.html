				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					</p>My partner, Gabe Ahrens, and I collaborated an idea of what we both should do for our world generator.
					We thought of making a rock wall generator with small creatures crawling on it. 
					This is the inspiring picture it's based off of:</p>
					<img src="./imag/images.jpg" width="500">

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> 
					<p> preloud function loads all of the images I drew</p> 
					<p>spawnBugs functions sets the position and the speed of the bugs.</p>
					<p>setup function sets up the snails positions and the drawBefore functions makes the snails slowly drift. </p>
					<p>drawAfter function makes the bugs moves across the screen</p>
					<p>drawTiles function generated the brick wall like world along with the snail image. It also places the images of the slugs, and has the clicks be slugs.</p>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> I worked on this with a parnter, Gabe Ahrens. We ended up making our own versions of our inspirations. I felt like we did equal work on our own world generators. 
					I was having more of a hard time making the slugs from the clicker appear on the wall. It kept hiding behind the tiles. I feel like I did okay on this assignment.
					I wasn't feeling too well when I finished this project so I feel like I could have put more effort into it if I had more time, and if I didn't feel so unwell.
